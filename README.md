# Scraped


Using Mongo / Mongoose:


The structure of a NoSQL database is something other than a table. There are several different types of NoSQL databases, such as key-value and graph. In this unit I learned MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL database. MongoDB documents correspond to a row, or record, in SQL, but unlike rows, documents are analogous to JSON objects. I can see why MongoDB is a popular choice for Node.js developers!

Rather than object-relational mapping, we will implement object-document mapping, or ODM, with Mongoose.js.

All The News That's Fit To Scrape
In this assignment, I will create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news. But I'm not going to actually write any articles; instead, I will flex my Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.
